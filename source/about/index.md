## 关于我

```
   世界变化太快。一个阶级得到利益。另一个阶级失去利益，我就是那失去利益的一部分人。个人力量实在太小了。我没法改变任何事情。我只能做到不断变得有价值让自己有权利选择想要的环境和生活。所以我不去花时间在抱怨社会上面或者像过去一年我学习哲学，马克思思想，了解历史。郁郁寡欢这事早在过去我就做过了。去了解社会真相这件事我早就做过了。现在我需要做的是选择生活！
   我永远不会忘记我所经历的一切，我永远是一个无产阶级，无论将来在什么地方。我把开源当作信仰，就当是我对马克思事业能做到为数不多的事情和对它为数不多的精神寄托吧！
   热爱技术，热爱生活，热爱生命！
   现实和网络要一样精彩

## About me

```
The world is changing too fast. One class gains. Another class loses, and I'm part of that loss. I'm part of that losing class. I can't change anything. I can only do what I can to keep on becoming valuable so that I can have the right to choose the environment and life that I want. So I don't spend my time complaining about society or studying philosophy, Marxian thought, and learning about history like I have been doing for the past year. I've done this in the past by being depressed. I've done this long ago to learn the truth about society. Now all I need to do is choose life!
   I will never forget what I have been through and I will always be a proletarian, wherever that may be in the future. I take open source as a religion, consider it one of the few things I can do for the Marxian cause and one of the few spiritual attachments I have to it!
   Love technology, love life, love life!
   Reality and the internet have to be just as exciting
